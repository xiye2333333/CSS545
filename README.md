Explanation:
Golden Path: First, users press Start Button  to start the service. The app will run in the background and show a floating button  on the foreground screen. Second, users can press this floating button to begin translation. Users can choose an area by swiping and the translation will show up in the bottom. Finally, users can press back button   to back the foreground screen. 

Target demographic: Students who need to read foreign language articles on mobile devices. The app will run on the background, so that it will not cover the screen which the user is currently reading. Users do not need to copy the content or upload the image and open another translation app. Instead, our app allows users to just press a button to get the translation, which makes it convenient, causing less distribution for usersâ€™ reading.
